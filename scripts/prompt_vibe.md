# Local Projections

Write a script to demonstrate the difference between the local projection and the VAR model in estimation the impulse response function.

Need to show the uncertainty of the estimation methods via simulations.

You decide what data generating process to use.

Run simulation for 100 times, and plot the confidence interval.

Put code in a `*.py` file, and showcase the results in a `*.ipynb* file, with interpretation of the results.
