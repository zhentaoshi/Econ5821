## What is a Jupyter Notebook?

* A document that mixes
	- narrative text (Markdown)
	- equations (LaTeX)
	- code (Python/R/Julia/...)
	- outputs (tables, figures, interactive widgets)

::: fragment
Good for *research that needs to be explained and verified*, not just executed.

## Why notebooks in scientific research?

* Reproducibility: code + outputs + explanation in one place
* Transparency: show assumptions, steps, and diagnostics
* Exploration: rapid iteration, visualization, and hypothesis generation
* Communication: easier to share with collaborators and future-you

---

## A typical research workflow

* Question → data → cleaning → analysis → validation → write-up
* Notebooks can support the whole pipeline:
	- data audit and cleaning logs
	- exploratory analysis and model development
	- robustness checks
	- plots and summary tables for papers/slides

---

## Anatomy of a notebook

* **Cells**
	- Markdown cells: explanation, formulas, interpretation
	- Code cells: computation
* **Kernel**: the runtime that executes your code
* **State**: variables persist across cells (powerful, but risky)

---

## Markdown with math

* Use headings, bullet points, and links to guide the reader
* Use LaTeX for math

$$
\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y
$$

---

## Outputs that matter in science

* Tables: descriptive stats, regression outputs
* Figures: distributions, time series, diagnostics
* Interactive: sliders / widgets (useful for teaching & sensitivity checks)

::: fragment
Tip: outputs should answer a question, not just “look nice”.

---

## Reproducibility

* A new user can run from top to bottom and get the same results
* The environment is specified
	- Python version and packages
	- data sources (where they come from)
* Randomness is controlled (set seeds)

---

## Reproducibility pitfalls

* Hidden state: running cells out of order
* Hard-coded file paths ("/Users/..." or "C:\\...")
* Downloading data without recording version/date
* Manual edits to data files with no log

---

## Best practices

* Restart kernel and **Run All** before sharing
* Keep notebooks focused: one notebook = one story
* Put reusable code in scripts/modules (not copied across notebooks)
* Separate:
	- raw data (read-only)
	- processed data
	- results/figures

---

## Version control with notebooks

* Use Git for:
	- code, text, configs
	- small/medium data (not huge raw datasets)
* Notebooks contain outputs → diffs can be noisy

::: fragment
Options: clear outputs before committing, or use tools that produce cleaner diffs.

## JupyterLab, VS Code, and Quarto

* **JupyterLab**: classic notebook-focused IDE
* **VS Code**: notebooks + Python tooling + Git in one place
* **Quarto**: turn notebooks/Markdown into reports and slides

---

## Summary

* Notebooks are excellent for research exploration and communication
* Treat them like scientific documents: clarity + traceability
* Pair notebooks with good habits: environments, version control, and rerunnable workflows
